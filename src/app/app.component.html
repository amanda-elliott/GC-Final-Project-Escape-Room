    <h2>Welcome to BlackOut!</h2>
      <p>You are now trapped in a dark place and the only way out is through a series of rooms.  So let’s play a game, shall we? In the first room, you will need to find one item that interacts with another item in order to move into the next room.  Seems easy right? Well that’s where you’re wrong! Each room you enter gets increasingly more difficult to exit. Once you reach the last room, you must use your smarts and keep your wits about you to find the final item that will lead to your grand escape from BlackOut!</p>
